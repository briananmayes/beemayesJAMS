		<p>Drake - Nothing Was The Same</p>
		<p>Although I dislike Drake with all of the dislike that is in my heart, I have to give it to him. NWTS was a pretty decent album coming from him.
			I must say I have to skip over "Hold On, We're Going Home" every time because of the overplay on the radio, NWTS gets a solid C+. Yeah, that's quite
			a lot for a Drake album coming from me. Solid 6/10.</p>

		<p>Cousin Stizz - Suffolk County</p>
		<p>Now everyone knows how much I LOVE Cousin Stizz. He along with his entire crew - composing of Michael Christmas, OG Swaggerdick, Jefe Replay, Big Leano -
			have put Boston on a hip-hop map that the city has never before seen. As a Houston native from the land where screw music was born, I did not expect much from 
			Boston's hip-hop scene. However, Cousin Stizz has proved me wrong and proved Boston right with his latest release "Suffolk County." With the help of his incredible produceers,
			Stizz has produced trap anthems and quotables for the next decade. A+</p>

		</figure>
		<p>I am a huge Dom K fan. Ever since I first heard "My Type of Party" I was hooked to this West Coast sensation. From <i>The Original Dom Kennedy</i> to <i>Yellow Album</i> to 
			<i>Get Home Safely</i> Dom Kennedy never disappointed me one second. I can listen to each of these albums all the way through without any complaints or any skips. However, with the
			release of <i>By Dom Kennedy</i> I saw a change in Dom's style and music that I was not a very big fan of. B-</p>
